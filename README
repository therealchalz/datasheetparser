This is a little script to parse copied text from the STM32L4 Technical Reference Manual and generate libopencm3-compatible driver header files, which contain registers and bits.

See the example directory for an example input and output.  The input was just selected from the relevant section of the TRM and copied.

Usage:
Select the section of the datasheet that you want to parse. Copy. Run. Paste.

For example, from the STM32L4 Technical Reference Manual, I'd select this
part, between the double quotes:

"
40.8.1  Control register 1 (USART_CR1)
Address offset: 0x00
Reset value: 0x00
<register info>
Bits 31:29 Reserved,
blah blah blah...
40.8.2  Control register 2 (USART_CR2)
.........
blah blah blah, to the end of the last bit of the last register
"

Copy that to the clipboard and then run the software.  It will:
- Read the text from the clipboard
- Try to parse it
- Save the output to your clipboard (as well as print it).

Then you:
- Paste it into your code
- Select the next section you're interested in
- Rinse and repeat
